# `ops/runbooks/`

Operational steps that are performed once, by a person, against something outside the
repository - so they cannot be a script and must not be lost in a pull request body.

| Runbook | Status |
|---|---|
| [`storefront-import.md`](storefront-import.md) | **Blocked** - needs the storefront repository URL (ADU-REPO-01 v1.2 S11 step 2) |
| [`grant-founder-operator.md`](grant-founder-operator.md) | **Ready** - run once the founder account exists (T4 Phase F) |

**Written at T4 Phase F.** The founder operator grant is now
[`grant-founder-operator.md`](grant-founder-operator.md). It could never have been a
migration: no founder account id exists until someone signs up through the ordinary
phone-OTP path, and a grant is a decision about a person recorded in an append-only table.

**Still owed:** the ADU-CON-02 S20.6 set - `deploy`, `rollback`, `restore-drill`,
`incident`, `sms-failover`, `key-rotation`, `db-upgrade`. Each needs a deployment that
exists.
